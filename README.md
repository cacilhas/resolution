# Resolution

Crate to retrieve screen resolution/dimensions on Linux and macOS.

## Rational

I have rewrite this same code so many times that it has proved its necessity
to exist.

## Install

```sh
cargo add resolution
```

## Interface

- `resolution::current_resolution() -> Result<(i32, i32), resolution::ResolutionError>`

It receives no parameter and returns current screenâ€™s `(width, height)`.
